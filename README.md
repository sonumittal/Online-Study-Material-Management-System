# Online-Study-Material-Management-System
I have felt during my exam preparation, i and many students are facing a problem finding/managing 
study material and previous years' exam papers in a single place. So, 
for solving this problem Online Study Material System is one of the 
very efficient and effective ways to provide study material and 
Previous year question papers on an online platform to help students 
and maximize benefits. Keeping this in mind, we plan to make a web 
application for managing and providing Question Papers and Study 
Materials to the students of the CSE department.
Towards this end, The implementation of this platform is done by 
using HTML, CSS, JavaScript to create the frontend, PHP for the 
backend, and MySQL, SQL for Database Management System. 
The application will store Question Papers and Study Materials in pdf, 
docs, ppt, jpeg, and png formats. 
The application is flexible, simple, efficient, and user-friendly.
